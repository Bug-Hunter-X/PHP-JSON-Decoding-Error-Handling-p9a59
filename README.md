# PHP JSON Decoding: Robust Error Handling

This repository showcases a common error in PHP when handling JSON data and provides a solution for more robust error handling.

The `bug.php` file demonstrates the problem: it attempts to decode JSON data without first checking for potential errors during file reading, which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. The improved solution is in `bugSolution.php`.
